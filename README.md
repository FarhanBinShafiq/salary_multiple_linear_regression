## Profit Prediction Using Multiple Linear Regression

## overview


This project implements a Multiple Linear Regression model to predict business profits based on features such as Marketing Spend, Administration costs, Transport costs, and geographical Area. The dataset (online.csv) contains 50 records of business data from three regions: Dhaka, Chittagong (Ctg), and Rangpur. The goal is to analyze how these independent variables influence profit (the dependent variable) and evaluate the model's performance using the R-squared metric.

This repository serves as a demonstration of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning model implementation using Python. It’s ideal for showcasing data analysis and machine learning skills in a portfolio.

## Dataset
The dataset (online.csv) includes the following columns:

Marketing Spend: Amount spent on marketing (numeric).
Administration: Administrative costs (numeric).
Transport: Transportation costs (numeric).
Area: Region of operation (categorical: Dhaka, Ctg, Rangpur).
Profit: Target variable, the profit earned (numeric).
