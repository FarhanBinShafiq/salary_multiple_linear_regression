Profit Prediction Using Multiple Linear Regression
Overview
This project implements a Multiple Linear Regression model to predict business profits based on features such as Marketing Spend, Administration costs, Transport costs, and geographical Area. The dataset (online.csv) contains 50 records of business data from three regions: Dhaka, Chittagong (Ctg), and Rangpur. The goal is to analyze how these independent variables influence profit (the dependent variable) and evaluate the model's performance using the R-squared metric.

This repository serves as a demonstration of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning model implementation using Python. It’s ideal for showcasing data analysis and machine learning skills in a portfolio.

Dataset
The dataset (online.csv) includes the following columns:

Marketing Spend: Amount spent on marketing (numeric).
Administration: Administrative costs (numeric).
Transport: Transportation costs (numeric).
Area: Region of operation (categorical: Dhaka, Ctg, Rangpur).
Profit: Target variable, the profit earned (numeric).
Rows: 50
Columns: 5

Code Explanation
1. Data Loading and Exploration
Libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, os) are imported.
The dataset is loaded from online.csv using pd.read_csv().
Basic exploration is performed:
os.listdir(): Lists files in the directory.
df.shape: Checks dataset dimensions (50 rows, 5 columns).
df.isnull().sum(): Confirms no missing values.
2. Data Preprocessing
Feature Separation:
x: Independent variables (Marketing Spend, Administration, Transport, Area).
y: Dependent variable (Profit).
One-Hot Encoding:
The categorical Area column is encoded using pd.get_dummies() with drop_first=True to avoid multicollinearity (Dhaka and Rangpur as dummy variables, Ctg as the baseline).
The original Area column is dropped, and encoded columns are concatenated to x.
3. Model Training
The dataset is split into training (75%) and testing (25%) sets using train_test_split from sklearn.
A Multiple Linear Regression model is trained using LinearRegression from sklearn.
4. Prediction and Evaluation
Predictions are made on the test set (pred = reg.predict(xtest)).
Model performance is evaluated using the R-squared score (r2_score), yielding a value of 0.884, indicating that 88.4% of the variance in profit is explained by the model.
Results
R-squared Score: 0.884 (88.4% accuracy in explaining profit variance).
Example Predictions vs Actual Values (from pred and ytest):
Index	Actual Profit	Predicted Profit
28	103282.38	103501.08
11	144259.40	128011.28
2	191050.39	173381.97
The model performs well, with predictions closely aligning with actual profits.

Future Improvements
Add data visualization (e.g., scatter plots of predicted vs. actual profits).
Experiment with feature scaling (e.g., StandardScaler) to improve model performance.
Test other regression models (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) for comparison.
Handle potential outliers in the dataset.
